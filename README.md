# Checkmate_To_Do_List_tracker
Week 5 Group project for splitstack program

This is the first group project for the UCF SplitStack program - Fall 2025 Front-End track. 

The project name is Checkmate, and To-Do list tracker where you can create To-Do lists, select them, and add items as needed to any list you need to.

You can add a List Name under the 'Create New List' input area on the left hand side of the page. Click the + button to add that list name. Each list name will populate below. If you want to delete a list, there is a X to remove. You can then click on any list name created, and it will populate under the Selected List area on the middle of the page.

(in development) Once the list name is showing in the Selected List area, you will be able to add items to that list, check items off, and save.

Files that were added: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Tailwinds was used for some of the styling of the page.

This project was contributed by Team CTRL Freaks which contains members: Caleb Lilijeros, Caroline Soliman, and Frank Spitzock.
